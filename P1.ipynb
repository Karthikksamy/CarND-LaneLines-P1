    "# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** \n",
    "***\n",
    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

    "This is a great concept for the project idea. Before starting this project, the only knowledge I had on python is to print a line. Going through the entire image processing pipeline was just awesome. Large amount of time was taken in implementing the ideas in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are different options tried out, that were a failure,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tried FFT for list of lines, hoping to find the most prominent line slope. But could not successfully find the amplitude of signal with highest frequency. Eventually resorted to weighted average of slopes to filter out the most prominent line\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Without weighted avergae of the slopes, just taking the slopes to filter out the lines would result in a statistical error, where most number of lines were staright but representing other objects in the plane. other interesting consequence of the weighted average method,\n",
    "   a. When taking a curve, the lines in the nearer field would get filtered out, due to a greater variation in slope. so, extrapolation needs to be done towards the bottom\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. Extrapolating the line - remember the origin is in top left of the image. so,\n",
    "   a. visualing increasing slope, the left lane is negative instead of positive\n",
    "   b. While extrapolating the left line x1,y1 needs to be extended down on the left. while x4,y4 needs to be exteded down on the left\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Limitations of the algorithm\n",
    "The algortihtm uses a hard coded value for the view width to determing the masking filter. Hence, it would not work on the challenge problem as it is. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feedback for next iteration of the course\n",
